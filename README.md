# Block Shuffle

This is a remake of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p34C7fNFgTA) video by Dream.

The list of blocks that the game uses are found in `blocks.yml`. This can be modified, but I feel that the default list provides a fun, while occasionally challenging game.

### Commands
* `/blockshuffle add <player>` - Adds a player to the game. (OP)
* `/blockshuffle remove <player>` - Removes a player from the game. (OP)
* `/blockshuffle start` - Start the game. (OP)
* `/blockshuffle stop` - Stop the game. (OP)
* `/blockshuffle skip` - Skip the current block for all players. (OP)
* `/blockshuffle join` - Join the game.
* `/blockshuffle leave` - Leave the game.
* `/blockshuffle list` - List the players in the game.

*Note: Commands marked (OP) require `/op` to execute.*

### The Game
Players' blocks are displayed on the scoreboard, along with whether they have found it, and the time remaining.
